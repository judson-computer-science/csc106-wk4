# Week 4

## Exercise 1
Write a program that takes 2 strings a `String` from STDIN and does the following:
- Print both values
- checks if the second is contained within the first
- checks if the first starts with the second
- checks if the first ends with the second
- checks if they are equal (not case sensitive)
- checks if each is a palindrome (hint: use the `StringBuilder`)
